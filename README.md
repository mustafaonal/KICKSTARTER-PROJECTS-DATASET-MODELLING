# KICKSTARTER-PROJECTS-DATASET-MODELLING
Kickstarter projects dataset is a dataset collected from the website of the corporation known as Kickstarter where original and creative projects that need a starter funding are published. It is a global crowdfunding platform for gathering the necessary starting money for a project to come to life. For funds to be collected, the project creators must meet the project deadline. Backers pledge to the projects that they want to come to life and project creators set a minimum goal to publish the project.  In this project it is aimed to determine which features make the Kickstarter Projects successful or not. For this purpose, data preprocessing and cleaning operations will be made to have a smoother dataset and different machine learning algorithms will be trained in order to find the best performing model.
